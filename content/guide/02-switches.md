Every key on your keyboard sits atop a switch - a mechanism that converts your physical press into an electrical signal. The type of switch determines how your keyboard feels and sounds.

## Membrane Switches

Most keyboards use membrane switches: two flexible plastic sheets with conductive traces. When you press a key, the top membrane pushes down and contacts the bottom membrane, completing a circuit. These switches are inexpensive and quiet, but they lack tactile precision and wear out faster.

## Mechanical Switches

Mechanical keyboards use individual switches under each key. Each switch contains a spring, a stem, and metal contact leaves. When you press the key, the stem pushes down, and at a certain point (the "actuation point"), the contacts meet and the circuit closes.

Mechanical switches come in three main types:

- **Linear**: Smooth press from top to bottom (e.g., Cherry MX Red)
- **Tactile**: A noticeable bump at the actuation point (e.g., Cherry MX Brown)
- **Clicky**: Tactile bump plus an audible click (e.g., Cherry MX Blue)

The actuation point (where the key registers) is usually higher than the bottom-out point (where the key stops moving). Skilled typists often learn to release keys just past actuation, enabling faster typing.

## The Contact Bounce Problem

When metal contacts meet, they don't make clean contact instantly. They literally bounce - making and breaking connection several times over a few milliseconds. This "contact bounce" would register as multiple key presses without proper handling, which brings us to debouncing.
